            <h2>hi, I'm avani!</h2>
            <h4>My mission is to empower people by building human-centric technologies.</h4>
            <h4>An imaginative and logical mode of thinking drives my love for
computer science. As a CS major at Cornell, and in my recent software development
internship at <a href="http://uncorkedstudios.com">Uncorked Studios</a>,
I have enjoyed using this mindset to carry out complex projects such as
<a href="http://levar.io">Levar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rachelshim/Risc">Risc</a>. </h4>
            <h4>My lifelong interest in education has motivated me to serve as a
course consultant for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2110/2017sp/lecturenotes.html">CS 2110</a>,
as a calculus tutor, and as co-founder, teacher, and advisor for
<a href="http://t13.njdeep.com/">Summer of CS</a>.</h4>
            <h4>My fascination with languages has driven me to
pursue a minor in linguistics and take Hindi courses.</h4>
            <h4>I believe in the necessity of advocating for diversity in tech.
As Co-President of <a href="http://wicc.acm.org">Women in Computing at Cornell</a>,
I lead a team of 30+ brilliant VPs and directors to foster an inclusive and supportive environment
within Cornell's CIS community.</h4>
            <h4>In my spare time, I can be found singing,
            reading, taking aesthetic photos or perusing memes. Feel free to reach out anytime-
            I would love to chat!</h4>
